            <h3>What is the difference between authentication and authorization?</h3>
            <p>
                While authentication and authorization are often used interchangeably, they are separate processes used to protect an organization from cyber-attacks. As data breaches continue to escalate in both frequency and scope, authentication and authorization are the first line of defense to prevent confidential data from falling into the wrong hands. As a result, strong authentication and authorization methods should be a critical part of every organizationâ€™s overall security strategy.

            <h3></h3>
            <p></p>
            <p></p>
        </div>
